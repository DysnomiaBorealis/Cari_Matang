Cari Matang Android App

This Android application is primarily built using the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture, with some elements adapted from the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
Features:

1. FASTApi Backend Integration: The app fetches data from a backend powered by FASTApi.
2. Camera Functionality: Users can capture images using both IntentCamera and Camera X.
3. User Authentication: The app provides login functionality through Firebase Authentication.
4. Webview Integration: A built-in webview allows users to directly interact with the FASTApi interface.
5. Youtubeview that's integrated via Firebase-app and using android youtube player library

This app was built by me and my teammates at Bangkit Academy H-1 in order to complete our capstone project.

Here are some UI designs of the app
